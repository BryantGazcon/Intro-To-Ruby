# What is an Array?
- an array is an ordered list of elements that can be of any tape. define an array by placing a list of elements between brackets
- arrays can have anything in them even other arrays, they can have strings, integers, and floats
## Array Methods
- to find first element of an array you can use first method (array.first)
- to find last element array.last
- to find third element in an array we can call an element using its index number array[3]
- all array indices start with 0

# Modifying Arrays
- to take the last item off an array permanently we can use pop method
- when calling the pop methid the original array variable was modified (pop is a method that mutates the caller (array is caller .pop is method))
- mutating the caller modifies the object(this case the array) used to call the method
- to add item back to array permanently you can use push method and send it the parameters you'd like to add
- .push('a string') or array << 'another string'
- PUSH, <<, and pop mutate the caller so original array is modified
