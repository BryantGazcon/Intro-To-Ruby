What is expection handling and what problem does it solve?

- Exception Handling is the process in which errros are dealt with in a manageable
and predicatable way. When programs interact with the real word many issues
can arise, therefore through the use of reserved word rescue we can implement
it into our code to provide an alternative in the event of an operation faliure.
